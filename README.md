## üìã Requirements

### Ollama Installation

This application requires [Ollama](https://ollama.ai/) to be installed and running locally.

#### Install Ollama

**macOS/Linux:**
```bash
curl -fsSL https://ollama.ai/install.sh | sh
```

**Windows:**
Download from [ollama.ai](https://ollama.ai/download)

#### Install Required Model

The application is configured to use the `llama3.2:1b` model by default. Install it with:

```bash
ollama pull llama3.2:1b
```

#### Start Ollama Server

```bash
ollama serve
```

The server will run on `http://localhost:11434` by default.

### Web Server

Since the application loads JSON files via fetch API, you need to serve it through a web server (not just open the HTML file directly).

## üöÄ Usage

### 1. Start Ollama

Make sure Ollama is running with the required model:

```bash
# Start Ollama server
ollama serve

# In another terminal, verify the model is available
ollama list
```

### 2. Start Web Server

Navigate to the project directory and start a local web server:

**Using Python:**
```bash
# Python 3
python3 -m http.server 8080

# Python 2
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080
```

**Using Node.js:**
```bash
npx http-server -p 8080
```

**Using PHP:**
```bash
php -S localhost:8080
```

### 3. Open Application

Open your web browser and navigate to:
```
http://localhost:8080/email_prompt_generator.html
```

### 4. Generate Email Content

1. **Select a Prompt**: Choose from the dropdown menu of 71 email prompts
2. **Review Prompt**: The selected prompt text will be displayed
3. **Generate Content**: Click "Generate Email Content" to send the prompt to Ollama
4. **Edit Content**: Use the rich text editor to modify the generated content
5. **Copy/Export**: Copy the final content for use in your email campaigns

## üîß Configuration

### Changing the AI Model

To use a different Ollama model, edit the `email_prompt_generator.html` file and change the model name:

```javascript
// Line ~306
body: JSON.stringify({
    model: 'your-preferred-model',  // Change this
    prompt: selectedPrompt.prompt,
    stream: false
})
```

Popular Ollama models you can use:
- `llama3.2:1b` (default - fast, lightweight)
- `llama3.2:3b` (better quality, slower)
- `llama3.1:8b` (high quality, requires more resources)
- `codellama:7b` (specialized for code-related content)

### Customizing Prompts

The email prompts are stored in `email_prompts.json`. Each prompt has the following structure:

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "source": "sendboard",
  "category": "Welcome Emails",
  "title": "Personalized welcome email to new newsletter subscribers",
  "prompt": "Compose a warm, personalized welcome email..."
}
```

You can add, modify, or remove prompts by editing this file. Make sure to:
- Keep unique incremental IDs
- Maintain valid JSON structure
- Include all required fields

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Generate Email Content" button is disabled:**
- Make sure you've selected a prompt from the dropdown
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors

**"undefined" appears in dropdown:**
- Verify that all entries in `email_prompts.json` have `id` fields
- Check that the JSON file is valid

**Ollama connection errors:**
- Ensure Ollama is running: `ollama serve`
- Verify the model is installed: `ollama list`
- Check that Ollama is accessible at `http://localhost:11434`

**CORS errors when loading JSON:**
- Make sure you're accessing the page through a web server, not opening the HTML file directly
- Use `http://localhost:8080` instead of `file://`

### Browser Console Debugging

The application includes detailed console logging. Open your browser's developer tools (F12) and check the Console tab for detailed information about:
- JSON loading status
- Prompt selection events
- Ollama API requests and responses
- Error messages
